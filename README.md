The Predictive Model for Problematic Planning Applications project aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of local councils in managing planning applications. In many jurisdictions, the planning application process can be complex and time-consuming, with applications often facing delays or refusals. This project seeks to address these challenges by providing a robust machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of planning applications being deemed problematic based on historical data.

Objectives
Identify Problematic Applications: The primary goal of the model is to identify applications that are likely to face issues such as refusals or require additional scrutiny. By doing so, councils can prioritize their resources and focus on applications that may need more attention.

Enhance Decision-Making: The model provides data-driven insights that support decision-makers in understanding the factors contributing to problematic applications. This can lead to more informed and consistent decision-making processes.

Optimize Resource Allocation: By predicting which applications are likely to be problematic, councils can allocate their staff and resources more effectively, reducing the burden on planning departments and improving overall service delivery.

Methodology
The model employs various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to analyze historical planning application data. Key steps in the methodology include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that influence the likelihood of an application being problematic, such as processing time, application type, and planning authority.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training the model on historical data and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The model has demonstrated a high level of accuracy (over 99%).
Benefits
Proactive Management: Councils can proactively address potential issues before they escalate, improving the overall efficiency of the planning process.
Transparency and Accountability: The model supports transparent decision-making, allowing councils to justify their actions based on data-driven insights.
Continuous Improvement: The model can be updated with new data to refine predictions and adapt to changing trends in planning applications.
Conclusion
This predictive model represents a significant advancement in how local councils can approach the planning application process. By leveraging machine learning techniques, councils can make better-informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for both applicants and the community.
